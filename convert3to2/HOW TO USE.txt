pip install 3to2

rename 3to2 to 3to2.py (found in the Scripts folder of the Python directory)

Open a terminal window and run 3to2.py -w [file]


NB: You will either have to be in the same folder as 3to2.py or 
provide the full path to it when you try to run it. 
Same goes for the path to the file you want to convert. 
The easy way around this is to copy 3to2.py into the folder your py file
is in and just run the command inside that folder.
Use 3to2.py --help for info on how the script works.
